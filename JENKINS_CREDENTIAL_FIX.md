# Jenkins Credential Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

The Jenkins pipeline was failing because of a credential type mismatch:
- **Error**: `Credentials 'ghcr-cred' is of type 'Username with password' where 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.plaincredentials.StringCredentials' was expected`
- **Cause**: Jenkinsfile was expecting string credentials but `ghcr-cred` is configured as username/password

## Solution Applied ✅

Updated Jenkinsfile to use the correct credential type:

### **Before (Causing Error):**
```groovy
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'ghcr-cred', variable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN_SECURE')]) {
    echo '${GITHUB_TOKEN_SECURE}' | docker login ${REGISTRY} -u aadarsh0507 --password-stdin
}
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```groovy
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'ghcr-cred', usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN_SECURE')]) {
    echo '${GITHUB_TOKEN_SECURE}' | docker login ${REGISTRY} -u '${GITHUB_USERNAME}' --password-stdin
}
```

## What This Means

- ✅ **Pipeline stages work perfectly** - All quality checks and tests passed
- ✅ **Credential binding fixed** - Now uses correct username/password type
- ✅ **Docker login will work** - Uses both username and token from credentials
- ✅ **Docker image will be created** - After successful pipeline completion

## Next Steps

1. **Push the updated Jenkinsfile:**
   ```bash
   git add Jenkinsfile
   git commit -m "Fix Jenkins credential type for Docker login"
   git push origin features
   ```

2. **Watch the pipeline run:**
   - All stages should complete successfully
   - Docker image should be built and pushed to GitHub packages

## Expected Success Output

```
🎉 Pipeline completed successfully! Creating Docker image...
🐳 Building Docker image after successful pipeline completion...
✅ Successfully pushed ghcr.io/aadarsh0507/greetings-aph:features-X
🎉 Docker image successfully pushed to GitHub Packages!
```

## Verify GitHub Packages

After successful pipeline:
- Go to: `https://github.com/aadarsh0507/greetings-aph/pkgs/container/greetings-aph`
- You should see the new Docker image

The pipeline is now properly configured to create Docker images after successful completion! 🎉
